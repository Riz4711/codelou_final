          <p>This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Learn when to stop. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.
            </p>
          <p>Just let these leaves jump off the brush A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

  </p>
<p>Just let these leaves jump off the brush A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Water's like me. It's laaazy ...

<p>Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.
  </p>
<p>I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.
  </p>
<p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Just beat the devil out of it. And maybe a little bush lives there. You can do anything your heart can imagine. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?
  </p>
<p>Let the paint work. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.
  </p>
<p>You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Brown is such a nice color.
